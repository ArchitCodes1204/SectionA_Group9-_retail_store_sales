#  Dashboard Creation 

## Creating Pivot Tables

After cleaning the dataset, we created Pivot Tables to summarize and
analyze the data properly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Charts Created

Based on the Pivot Tables, we created 6 charts:

1.  Monthly Revenue Trend
2.  Payment Method Share'
3.  Percentage of Sales with Respect to Discount
4.  In-Store vs Online Growth
5.  Year-wise Category Sold
6.  Total Spent with Category

These charts help in understanding sales performance, customer behavior,
and revenue patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## KPI Metrics Added

We also created 5 KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards:

-   Total Revenue
-   Total Transactions
-   Total Quantity
-   Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth
-   Revenue Concentration Ratio

These KPIs provide a quick summary of overall business performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding Slicers

We added 3 slicers to make the dashboard interactive:

-   Category
-   Transaction Date
-   Payment Method

These slicers allow users to filter the dashboard easily and analyze
specific data segments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Dashboard Design

-   All charts and KPI cards were properly aligned.
-   Elements were placed in correct positions for better readability.
-   A suitable theme and styling were applied for a clean and
    professional look.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Result

After completing all these steps, our dashboard is fully ready.

It is clean, interactive, visually organized, and useful for analyzing
sales performance effectively.

## Project Overview
Retail companies often struggle to understand actual store performance due to messy and unstructured sales data. This makes it difficult for management to identify high-performing stores, profitable products, and improvement areas.

The objective of this project is to organize sales data, analyze key performance indicators, and support data-driven decision-making to improve sales performance and operational efficiency.
